# Normal-Distribution
This repository contains python program to plot graph of Normal Distribution. I have written this python programs using matplot library.

To clone this repository to your system you can paste and run the following command in your terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/hm05/Normal-Distribution.git
cd Normal-Distribution
```

Before running the program it is advisable to check if you have python installed on your device or not. To check this you can run this command
```
python --version
```
OR
```
python3 --version
```

After confirming python you need to install the dependencies, to do this you can run the following command
> If `python --version` works for you
```
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install scipy
```
> If `python3 --version` works for you
```
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install scipy
```

After the installation of dependencies you can run the program as follows

### For problem where we have to plot graph for the value of Xˉ is Less Than single observation
> `python --version` works for you
```
python ./XLessThan.py
```
> `python3 --version` works for you
```
python3 ./XLessThan.py
```

### For problem where we have to plot graph for the value of Xˉ is Greater Than single observation
> `python --version` works for you
```
python ./XGreaterThan.py
```
> `python3 --version` works for you
```
python3 ./XGreaterThan.py
```

### For problem where we have to plot graph for the value of Xˉ in fixed interval
> `python --version` works for you
```
python ./FixedInterval.py
```
> `python3 --version` works for you
```
python3 ./FixedInterval.py
```
